        The whole song cycle is absolutely fantastic but this particular song is my
        favourite. To provide some historical context, the song takes its words from a
        poem by Heinrich Heine. The original poem carries a bitter or sarcastic tone but
        Schumann slightly altered the words to portray a more amicable yet equally devastating
        song about lost love. After listening to this song cycle, I was propelled to learn
        about Schumann's captivating and heartbreaking life. This to me, is one of the most
        powerful elements of music; the ability to send one into the life of another generations past.
        I find the piano accompaniment particularly interesting, in a major key and a sort of monotonous
        rhythm. I would advise against the first result on YouTube since I believe it is sped up. The recording on YouTube that I'd recommend is Wolfgang Holzmair's, found <a href="https://youtu.be/DZ71bQBHfbg?t=7m47s" target="_blank">here</a>. Have a listen!
