        I've always been a fan of strong Russian music and this certainly is an
        example of simply put, a really well composed piece. It really doesn't need a
        lengthy written explanation, listening to a performance of it describes more than
        words ever can. The theme on its own is so ridiculously lyrical and romantic. It
        transfers across various voices and goes through thematic development without
        the phrasing ever feeling any less seamless than a bird gliding through clouds.
        When I listen to this, I envision a wintery landscape with some animated animal
        characters. If there is ever to be another Fantasia film, I think this piece
        would be a fantastic choice to animate a story around. There is such lyricism in every
        note. I don't have a strong preference for any particular recording to listen to but
        I have found the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTPrcBAq28Q" target="_blank">
        Emerson String Quartet performance</a> to be my favourite on YouTube. Have a listen!
