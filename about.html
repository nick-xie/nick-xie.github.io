<h4 class="about">about me</h4>
<p>
  I'm 20 years old and studying Computer Science with a minor in Music at the
  University of Waterloo. I like making stuff (like the site you're on right
  now!).
  <br /><br />
  Outside of tech, I run Track and Field and play violin but usually not at the
  same time.
  <br />
  On the track, I race the 800m which is two (fun filled) laps on a standard
  outdoor track.
  <br />
  I've been fortunate enough to be raised with music and violin and am so
  thankful for all the friends, experiences, support, and beauty it has and
  continues to bring to my life.
