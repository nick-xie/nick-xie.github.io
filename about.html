<h4 class="about">about me</h4>
<p>
  I'm 20 years old and studying Computer Science with a minor in Music at the
  University of Waterloo. I like making stuff (like the site you're on right
  now!).
  <br /><br />
  Outside of tech, I run Track and Field and play violin but usually not at the
  same time.
  <br />
  On the track, I race the 800m which is two (fun filled) laps on a standard
  outdoor track.
  <br />
  I am a longtime player of the violin and am so thankful for it bringing me
  many friends, experiences, and in general, more beauty in my life.
