<h4 class="about">about me</h4>
    <p class="meat" id="aboutme">
        I am 20 years old and am currently studying
        Computer Science with a minor in Music at the University of Waterloo.
        I enjoy movies, boardgames, math, and art!
        <br>Outside of tech, I pursue personal goals with Track and Field and music.
        On the track, I primarily race the 800m but also dabble around other distances.
        I am a longtime player of the violin and am so thankful for it
        bringing me many friends and experiences as well as
        allowing me to savour the beauty in my life more.
