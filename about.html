<h4 class="about">about me</h4>
    <p class="meat" id="aboutme">
        I am 18 years old and am currently studying
        Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.
        I enjoy thinking. I'm a huge fan of figuring out puzzles and
        brainteasters as well as reflecting on math and programming ideas.
        <br>Aside from tech, I take pleasure in racing competitive
        Cross Country and Track and Field with the
        varsity team as well as on my own.
        As well, I greatly appreciate the role music has in my life.
        It has brought me many friends and experiences as well as
        allowing me to savour my life more. I am a longtime player
        of the violin. Feel free to check out my blog or my media
        recommendations to learn more about me!
