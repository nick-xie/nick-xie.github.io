<h4 class="about">about me</h4>
<p>
  I'm 24 years old and am currently based in Toronto as a Software Developer.
  I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2021 with a degree in Computer Science Music minor.
  I like making stuff (like the site you're on right now!)
  <br /><br />
  I am interested in probably too many things but notably, I run track (800m) and
  play violin but usually not at the same time. I also like taking photos/editing stuff, you can check
  out some of my photos through the link below.
